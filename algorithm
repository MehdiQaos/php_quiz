start:
    get list of quizes
    make cards, and for each one set the id of the quiz in dataset attribute
    add event listeners for all cards and set the callback to `start_quiz` function:

start_quiz:
    fetch data of the quiz from the database as json
    initialize quiz variables: score=0, questionNumber=0, numQuestions
    make a new list of the questions sorted in randomized order
    call the new_question function

new_question:
    if questionNumber == numQuestions:
        return from the function
    increment questionNumber
    get a new question
    get the choices of the question and put them in random order
    call make_choices function
    set the timer by calling setInterval function and set callback to `timer` function

timer:
    if timer variable == 0:
        call clearInterval(myInterval)
        call new_question()
    else:
        increment the progressbar width
        increment timerElm innerText

make_choices:
    shuffle the choices
    make a dom element for each choice and set the dataset.number to the index of that choice
    add an event listener to each choice and set the callback to `get_answer`
    if the question is multiple add a submit button

get_answer:
    if acceptingQuestion=false:
        return
    acceptingQuestions=true
    clearInterval(myInterval)
    if question.answer=choice.dataset.index:
        increment score
        scoreElm.inneText=score
        add `correct` class to the choice
    else:
        add `incorrect` class to the choice
        add `correct` class to the right choice

    set a timeout of 1 second and set the callback to `new_question`
